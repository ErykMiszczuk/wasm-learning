## Building project
To build this project run
```
wasm-pack build
```
Then inside `www`
```
npm ci
```
Using `file:` directive inside `package.json` we can simply `import` files created on previous step.

## Notes   
After running `wasm-pack build` typescript server in vscode panics. Reloading helps.
You cannot run `npm ci` when Vite is running. Soooo, automated script to reinstall `wasm dependencies` in big no no. At least right now.
At least `wasm-pack build` will find cargo file in parent directory, so one `cd ..` less to compile rust code. Not sure if it will work when `www` and rust code will be in same direcotry.   

~~ Well it looks like `vite-plugin-wasm` have some problems folowing file resolutions for modules defined using `file:..` directive. Should be investigated more. ~~
It turns out that it also have problems with `../../` like paths soo i have to flatten the structure of project.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
* `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you
